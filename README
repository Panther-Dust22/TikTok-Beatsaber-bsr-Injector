Created by Emstar233 And Husband (V 1.0.7) Beta

Important:

Beta testers, In streamer.Bot please right click and delete/remove ALL actions first, you will need a new canvas for this. (feel free to make a Tutorial video on TikTok or Youtube)

Extract this folder to your computer in a safe place, for example C: drive (you will need to know where it is later in this setup)

Using this Method isn't perfect but it will allow TikTok Live viewers to interact with your stream by recommending songs from Beatsaver.com, you will also be able to see chat from TikTok in game on the BS+ chat screen.
To make this work, certain aspect's had to be edited to stop TikTok from blocking the requests, please advise your viewers by using the room Bio or on chat/voice/text overlay etc of the following, the bsr code should be put into chat WITHOUT the "!" (exclamation mark) at the front so it would read as "bsr 3b2a5" (<-- this is a Map we made enjoy) if the comment still gets blocked they should add their name after it, for example "bsr 3b2a5 frank001", this is to stop TikTok from seeing it as spam and allowing the post in to chat.

Please give credit where it is due, we did not create Streamer.bot, Tikfinity, Beat saber, BS+ Mod or Tiktok Live, we just had the idea to use our skills in Networking and Software Debugging to put this all together, it has taken a couple of weeks of work and a lot of Tea, we would really appreciate you visiting EmStar233's page and sharing/following/subscribing or dropping some gifts in our live streams.

you will require a Twitch account to make this work but you will never need to actively go on it (or have it open) this is because this does not Inject into the game (I'm not that clever) but rather uses some clever trickery to send messages to twitch using codes registered to the game that it reads from twitch directly from TikTok

Step 1, Download Streamer.Bot from the following link or use google to search it https://streamer.bot/

Step 2, Install Tikfinity from https://tikfinity.zerody.one/app/ or use google to find it.

Step 3, Install BeatsaberPlus from GitHub https://github.com/hardcpp/BeatSaberPlus/releases or use google to find it
     3.1, When you first launch BS+ your desktop will open a page to link in to your Twitch account and get an Oauth key (please make sure you do this or none of this will work).

Step 4, Time to configure Streamer.bot. (guide written for Streamer.bot V 0.2.3)
     4.1, open streamer.bot application (creating a shortcut to the app on your desktop will help) and click on Import
     4.2 In the BSR injector folder grab the "TikTok-Live-BSR-Injector-By-EmStar233.config" file and drag it into the box on streamer.bot labelled Import String and click import
     4.3 click on the Commands Tab and right click the only item in there (in red) and then click Enable
     4.4 click on the Servers/Clients Tab and you will be on the tab that says "WebSocket Server" not to be confused with "WebSocket server(s)"
     4.5 Tick the AutoStart box, and use these settings  Address:127.0.0.1 - Port:9090 - Endpoint:/SRM (case sensitive)
     4.6 Sign in to your Twitch account by going to the Tab "Platform" then the tabs down from that make sure "Twitch" is selected then underneath click "Accounts"
     4.7 Once logged in make sure to click connect on "Chat Client", "PubSub" and "Event Sub" (unless it auto connects them already)
     4.8 Click back to "Servers/Clients" Tab and click Start Server.

(NEW)4.9 On the "Actions" Tab, click the action "Chat" then, in the "Sub-Actions" window there is an item called "Write to file", double click on this (or right click and edit) click the button next to file to write to (three dot's) and navigate to where you stored the injector folder and select the "Tag file" and click yes to overwrite then ok on the write to file window.
(NEW)4.9.2, On the "Actions" Tab click the action "chat req claim" then, in the "Sub-Actions" window, double click the "Read Lines" entry and do the same as above by finding the file "Tag file"
NOTE: This "New" file allows the requests to be tagged by the person who requested them, just hover over them in your queue (in Beat saber) and it will be shown as a note popup, without this file its a guessing game.

(NEW)4.9.3, NOTE: This is a customisable option, and please note it will trigger any time "bsr" is written at the beginning of a message even if a map failed to inject (this cannot be helped), this is just a "thank you" message you can have played back to your players when they make a request.
(NEW)4.9.3.1, On the "Actions" Tab, click the Action "Message Reply", in the "Sub-Actions" window double click on the "Set argument" option (or right click and edit), in the box labelled "Value" enter your own Custom Thank you message, (DO NOT CHANGE VARIABLE NAME) then click "OK"
(NEW)4.9.3.2, If you do not want a notification (TTS SPAM) then right click on the action "Message Reply" from the "Actions" window then UNTICK "Always Run" and "Enabled"
You can now Minimise Streamer.bot (don't close)

Step 5, Open Tickfinity, its time for Setup
     5.1, Sign in to tickfinity using your tiktok account (this wont work without it)
     5.2, Scroll down the left panel and click Chatbot Tick Activate Chatbot and then scroll down the page to find Streamer.bot Messages
     5.3, Tick Allow Streamer.bot to push massages to Tikfinity and then click Configure Streamer.bot button
     5.4, In this box only we will repeat the Above Config settings Address:127.0.0.1 - Port:9090 - Endpoint:/SRM (CASE SENSATIVE)
     5.5, Click Test Connection, you should have a green box appear in the top right saying connection succesfull
     5.5.2, If the box is Red then it did not connect, please go back to step 4.4 and 4.5 and make sure you are using the correct settings/server Tab

Step 6, Configure Tikfinity Events and Actions (without this it will not work, also allows you to see chat in game)
     6.1, on the Left panel of Tikfinity click the Actions and Events Tab
     6.2, Create a new Action and use these settings (assume everything else is unticked)
     6.2.2, Name:BSR - Tick Streamer.Bot Action and on the dropdown click Chat - Display Duration 10 seconds - Additional settings leave as they are then click Save.
     6.3, Click Create New Event and use these settings (assume everything else is unticked)
     6.3.2 Trigger the event "Everyone" - What will trigger "Chat(any Comment)" - Trigger these actions "BSR"
     6.3.3 (optional) you can change event trigger from everyone to "followers" or "subscribers" etc but this will also stop comments from others appearing in the chat window
     Note: The purpose of this is to allow everyone to join in, the above optional setting is not recommended and we would suggest using your TikTok live moderation tools to MUTE or Kick/Ban offenders or spammers of this Injector if you have issues with viewers.

Step 7, Add Overlay to your Tiktok Live App
     7.1, Scroll down the screen to find "Overlay Screen Settings" and Highlight the link for "screen 1"
     7.2, Press CTRL and C on your keyboard to copy the address
     7.3, Open TikTok Live App
     7.4, Click "Add Source" on the left, Click "Link" in the box that has opened and then click "Add"
     7.5, Paste using CTRL and V on your keyboard into the address box, make sure sound is enabled if you would like to use speakerbot in the future and Finally Press Add Source.

Step 8 GO LIVE AND ENJOY THE BSR CODE INJECTION (please read notes below)

Note: if you know your way around Tikfinity you can adjust the above for a bit more customisation but please don't come and find me when you mess it up, just restart this Tutorial from scratch.
When going live please make sure you start Streamer.bot first, wait for it to load and then launch Tikfinity.
